This website has two licenses applied to it. To *the software*, the [**zero‐clause BSD** license][0BSD] applies, whereas to *the stories*, the [**Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International** license][CC BY 4.0] applies.

**“The stories”** refers to anything within the `stories` directory in the root of [the repository].

**“The software”** refers to anything else present in [the repository].

When browsing [the website] itself, a DOM [comment] [node] is (automatically) placed before the [HTML] [doctype] on *stories* (to which the [CC BY 4.0] license is applied), denoting the license for the webpage. Additionally, for each *story*, a visible footer that explicitly clarifies the applied license for users is added.
